# Postgres Commands

Generally speaking on local dev postgres should be configured to run on startup, but in case it isn't you should ensure that postgres has been started before spinning up the express server.

Here are some commands to start/stop/restart and check the status of postgres.

`pg_ctl start`

`pg_ctl stop`

`pg_ctl restart`

`pg_ctl status`
